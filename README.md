# Welcome to my IP repository!

Hi everybody :)

This is my first repository and love to share my programs with everybody as I consider myself an Open-Source advocate.

 1. **IP Detection**: This program detects IP with regex and recognize these:
    - [ ] IPv4 or IPv6
    - [ ] IP ranges
    - [ ] Valid or Invalid IP
2. **Decimal to IPv4**: This program convert decimal format to IP address from dotted-decimal address.
3. **IPv4 to Decimal**: This program translate IP address from dotted-decimal address to decimal format.
4. **Generate IPv4**: Give this program a first of a range and an end IP of that range and you get all IPs between them.
